Stacking/XGBoost

This notebook is a very basic and simple introductory primer to the method of ensembling (combining) base learning models, in particular the variant of ensembling known as Stacking. In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.
